Welcome to the **Front-End Web Development** course by Bayt-al-Hikmah! This repository offers a comprehensive set of lecture notes designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master front-end web development. Whether you're new to coding or enhancing your skills, these lectures provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core web technologies.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computers and file management.
    
- No prior programming or web development experience required (though helpful).
    
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
    

### Setup Instructions

1. Install a code editor: Visual Studio Code with extensions like "Live Server" is recommended.
    
2. Set up a local development environment:
    
    - Create a project folder for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
        
    - Use a browser's developer tools (F12) to test and debug.
        
3. Test your setup: Create a simple HTML file (example in Lecture 1) and open it with Live Server or a browser.
